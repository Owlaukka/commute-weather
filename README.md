# commute-weather [![Owlaukka](https://circleci.com/gh/Owlaukka/commute-weather.svg?style=svg)](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/Owlaukka/commute-weather)
Web-app for seeing weather at a requested time for roughly the next week. Original motivation for this was to use it for determining whether or not it makes sense to make a work-commute by foot or use a car/public transport.

## TODO
* Add users in the backend
* Further develop weather preferences (add to users in backend, add further aspects of weather like raining or not, etc...).
* Connect preferred commute time and other preferences to the user's account
* Allow for time range in commutes and calculate the weather for the whole period.
* Convert backend to typescript as well.
